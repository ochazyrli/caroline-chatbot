# CAROLLINE
**Your lovely beauty consultant**   
  
Carolline is the Chatbot and Recommendation System for the Beauty Products!  

## Background
We want to resolve the Paradox of Choice which is a condition where too many choices are available for the customer and can cause them stress and complicate the decision-making process. We exist to help customers in deciding on what beauty products they want to purchase.

## Datasets  
This dataset is the result of scrapping the Sephora Website, which contains more than 9000 products with their ratings and ingredient list. Dataset link: [Sephora Website](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/raghadalharbi/all-products-available-on-sephora-website).
